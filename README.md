# Intelligent LDPC Decoder

This project explores intelligent approaches to Low-Density Parity-Check (LDPC) decoding by integrating Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning techniques. LDPC codes are powerful error-correcting codes used in modern communication systems, and this repository contains three innovative modifications to traditional LDPC decoders.

## Project Overview

The repository contains three main approaches to improve LDPC decoding:

- **`ml-ldpc`** - Implements function approximation using machine learning for various components in the LDPC decoder
- **`nn-ldpc`** - Investigates the effectiveness of neural networks in decoding noisy binary signals
- **`rl-layered-ldpc`** - Uses reinforcement learning to find optimal layer sequences for faster packet decoding

## Features

- Multiple AI/ML approaches to LDPC decoding
- Parallel and distributed computing support (Dask-based)
- Layered decoding algorithms
- Neural network-based decoding models
- Reinforcement learning optimization

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/intelligent-ldpc-decoder.git
   cd intelligent-ldpc-decoder
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
